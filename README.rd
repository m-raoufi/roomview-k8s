# Laravel Application Deployment on Kubernetes

This repository provides a guide and example files for deploying a Laravel application on Kubernetes, including MySQL as the database and Nginx as the web server.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding with the deployment, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Kubernetes cluster up and running
- `kubectl` command-line tool configured to connect to your cluster

## Deployment Steps

Follow the steps below to deploy the Laravel application on Kubernetes:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
Customize the configuration files:

Adjust the MySQL and Laravel environment variables in the laravel-deployment.yaml file.
Modify the Nginx configuration in the nginx-configmap.yaml file according to your requirements.
Create the Kubernetes resources:

Apply the MySQL deployment and service:

bash
Copy code
kubectl apply -f mysql-deployment.yaml
Apply the Laravel deployment:

bash
Copy code
kubectl apply -f laravel-deployment.yaml
Apply the Nginx deployment, ConfigMap, and NodePort service:

bash
Copy code
kubectl apply -f nginx-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f nginx-configmap.yaml
kubectl apply -f nginx-service.yaml
Monitor the deployment:

Check the status of the deployments:

bash
Copy code
kubectl get deployments
Verify the status of the pods:

bash
Copy code
kubectl get pods
Access the Laravel application:

Get the NodePort assigned to the Nginx service:

bash
Copy code
kubectl get service nginx-service
Open a web browser and visit http://<NODE_IP>:<NODE_PORT> (replace <NODE_IP> and <NODE_PORT> with the appropriate values).
